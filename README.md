# Hello there!
It seems that you are interested in my GitHub [profile](https://github.com/angu-dev), that makes me very happy! In this file you will find information about me and my interests, some of my projects and my knowledge.

## About me
My name is **Andreas Gutmann** and I am a 20 year old **full-stack-developer**.  Since I was born I have lived in a small town called Babenhausen, which is located in Bavaria (Germany). 
During my training as an **IT specialist for application development** in the automotive industry, I was able to receive a lot of information and impressions.  
Since I am a very cheerful person who likes to deal directly with the topic of systems, I have gathered a certain **general knowledge** in development. 
I like to spend my free time doing small projects, trying out new games, doing sports, meeting up with friends or just having fun.

## Projects
Since the beginning of my training, I have dealt with problems every day. That is why I have **programmed libraries**, among other things, which simply remove them from the world.  
I also enjoy **developing websites** of any size that represent different types of private individuals or companies. Furthermore, I like to **write algorithms** that are supposed to relieve a little work for our humanity. Unfortunately, some of my projects cannot and will not be published on my [GitHub](https://github.com/angu-dev?tab=repositories).

## Knowledge
Through my work as a **full-stack developer**, I was able to gain a lot of experience in project planning, customer contact and the resources provided.
I **mostly** use the following languages for my projects:
- C#
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS/SCSS/SASS
- SQL (MySQL, MicrosoftSQL)
- Java
- Librarys/Frameworks (jQuery, dataTables, Bootstrap, ...)
